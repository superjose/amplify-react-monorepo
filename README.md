# amplify-react-monorepo
A Create-React App monorepo using amplify. This will have 2 create-react apps sharing code through a components folder that will host a storybook project. In addition, we will also sport pre-rendering in both create-react-app using a library called react-snap. You can extend this library from here and continue developing further. 

This will also teach you how to do it using both: Yarn 1.x and Yarn 2!

This will also teach you in TypeScript.

Please, see the files on how to do it.
